## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- pip (Python package installer)  

### Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure your `model.pkl` file is in the same directory as `app.py`

### Running the Application

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Fill out the health assessment form and get your personalized heart health prediction!

## Usage

1. **Enter Health Information**: Fill out all the required fields in the health assessment form  
2. **Get Prediction**: Click "Analyze Heart Health" to get your AI-powered prediction  
3. **View Results**: See your risk score, detailed analysis, and personalized recommendations  
4. **Follow Recommendations**: Use the provided health recommendations to improve your cardiovascular health  

## Health Parameters

The application analyzes the following health parameters:

- **Age**: Your current age  
- **Sex**: Biological sex (M/F)  
- **ChestPainType**: Type of chest pain (TA, ATA, NAP, ASY)  
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure  
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol level  
- **FastingBS**: Whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1/0)  
- **RestingECG**: Results of resting electrocardiogram (Normal, ST, LVH)  
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise  
- **ExerciseAngina**: Whether exercise induces chest pain (Y/N)  
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise  
- **ST_Slope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment (Up, Flat, Down)  

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn compatible model  
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient animations  
- **Icons**: Font Awesome  

## Model Information

The application uses your pre-trained `model.pkl` file. The model should be trained on a heart disease dataset with the following features in order:

1. Age  
2. Sex (M/F)  
3. ChestPainType (TA/ATA/NAP/ASY)  
4. RestingBP (resting blood pressure)  
5. Cholesterol  
6. FastingBS (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  
7. RestingECG (Normal/ST/LVH)  
8. MaxHR (max heart rate)  
9. ExerciseAngina (Y/N)  
10. Oldpeak (ST depression)  
11. ST_Slope (Up/Flat/Down)  

**Target variable**: HeartDisease (1/0)
